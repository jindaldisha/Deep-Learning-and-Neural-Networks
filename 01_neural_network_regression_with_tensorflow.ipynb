        "Say we have to predict the price of house and we're given the values of number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms etc. We have to numerically enocode these values. And these are the input variables i.e. the input features. These features go into our machine learning algorithm, and our algorithm will make a prediction of the price (the label that we're trying to calculate) based on the input features. This predicted output comes out of learning off of various actual outputs. This is an example of Supervised Learning. We might have hundreds of/or thousands of different homes with all of their input features and their actual sale price. And then we might feed these inputs and outputs to our machine learning algorithm and its going to learn the relationships between the features and labels.  \n",
